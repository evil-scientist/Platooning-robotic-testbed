# Platooning-robotic-testbed
Robotic Testbed for Platooning or autonomous robotic cars with multiple on board processing, sensing and communication interfaces.

# High level Description
Developed as part of the Platooning use case of InSecTT project. This repository contains the design and fabrication of the main controller PCB for the robotic testbed. 
The robotic testbed consists of autonomous programmable (small scale) robotic cars which can be used to emulate the platooning behavior using real life hardware. 
The aim is to have HiL testing and validation of different platooning and communication protocols and algorithms developed as part of this use case and to collect real life network data statistics. 
The testbed will serve as an open-source platform to validate platooning algorithms.

The comprehensive PCB incorporates multiple sensor and communication interfaces, high power, high computation STM32 microcontroller, 
LIDAR, IMU, Ultrasonic sensors and additional wireless radios and raspberry pi module. The cars also support NXP-NLâ€™s 802.11p V2X radio chipset (focused on wireless security).

The fully assembled PCB can be seen below (top and bottom view):
